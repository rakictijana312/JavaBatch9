Variables
They hold data
    1) one value at a time what if we need to store more data we will have to declare
    that many variables not feasible.
Arrays:
Consecutive memory location pointed by a single variable
    1) Fixed in size once the array is declared we can not change the size
    2) If we declare a bigger array at the start we may be wasting memory
    3) if we declare a smaller array we have to do a lot of work to accommodate
    entries beyond the size of the array
To Rescue we have Collection framework in java
Collections Framework
is a collection of classes and interfaces that can hold objects as a single unit
like arrays but with a lot flexibility.

Pros
    1) Less code built-in methods to solve common problems that we may face
    2) no Fixed sizes all the classes in collections framework are flexible
    we don't need to declare the size upfront
    3) memory efficient

Cons:
we can not use primitive data types in collections framework
to overcome this issue we have wrapper classes.
Wrapper classes:
wrapper classes are just object equivalent of primitive types
for all of the primitive types we have wrapper classes
we can use them in collections framework
