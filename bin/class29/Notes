Class 29

Variables:
They hold data:
1)One value at a time what if we need to store more thata we will have
that more variables not fesible.

Arrays:
Consecutive memory locations pointed by a single variable
1) Fix in size once the array is declared we can not change the size
2) If we declare bigger arrat at the start we are maybe waisting memory
3) if we declare smaller array we have to do a lot of work to accomodate entries
beyond of size  of the array.
To Rescue we have collection framework in Java.

Collection is a collection of classes and interfaces that can hold objects as single unit like arrays
but with a lot of flexibility.
Benefits:
1) less code-build in methods to solve common problems that we mat face
2) no fixed sizes all theclass in colection framework are flexibile
we dont need to declare the size upfront
3) memory efficient

Cons:

We canot use primitive datatypes in collections framework
to overcome this issue we have wrapper classes.

Wrapper classes are just object equivalent of primitive types forr all
of primitive types we have wrapper classes and this wrapper classes we can use in colection framework
