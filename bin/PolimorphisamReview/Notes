SuperKeyword
we can use super keyword to access constructors or methods or fields from parent class in
child class
when it makes sense to use super keyword
if we have the same name fields or methods in the parent and child classes then we can
use the super keyword with the "this" keyword to distinguish between the fields of child
class and parent class
Most widely use of super
Super is widely used to call the constructor from the parent class
============================================
Method overloading
Overloading is a mechanism in java where same method or constructor
can exist with different parameters within a class.
Uses
cleaner code
we do not need to come up with a new name every time if a method is doing the same thing
but with different parameters
We can overload our methods
    1) Changing the number of parameters
    2) changing the type of parameters
    3) by changing the sequence of parameters

we call it static binding ,compile time polymorphism early binding.
=============================================
Method Overriding:
A mechanism through which parent and child classes can have the same methods
if child class does not like the implementation from the parent class
    1)we can not override private methods and constructor because they don't participate in
    the inheritance and are not available in child classes
    2)we can not decrease the visible because it breaks the inheritance contract
    3) static methods can not be overridden they belong to class not object we can hide/re-declare
    4) methods must have the same signature and return type
    5) final methods can not be overridden
    6)subclass in different package can only override methods that are
    public or protected
    7) there should an inheritance relationship

it is also called dynamic binding, late binding,runtime polymorphism.
=================================================================
Final Keyword:
Final is non access modifier that used when we have to say something
is complete and don't need modification
when used with class no other class can inherit it
when used with variables we can not change the value of that variable
when used with methods those methods can not be overridden.
