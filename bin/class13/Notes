In this part of the java sessions
we will be learning how to write large amounts of java
code to make things easier like
1) Manging the code
2) changing the code
3) Using programing to solve real life issues more easily
===========================
OOP(Object oriented programing)
object oriented programing is a way of writing the code using the
idea of objects(Everything that you can see and touch around you).
its impossible to write any java programme with out these classes and object
Class is design/template/blueprint that has attributes(which will describe how the object
that will be created using that class will look like) and method/behaviours(how the object will
look like)
