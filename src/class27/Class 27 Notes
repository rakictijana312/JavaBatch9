Final Keyword:
Final is a keyword in java that belongs to non access modifiers.
we can use final keyword with variables,methods and classes.
With variables:
when used with variables we can not change the content of that variable.
but if that variables points to an array or any other object we can change
the contents of that array or object.

class A{
int number;
String name;

A(int number,String name){
this.number=number;
this.name=name;
}
public static void main(String[] args){


final A var1=new A(12345,"Bryan");
var1.number=100;
var1=new A(45678,"Alec");
final int[] arr={123,145,456}

arr={100,58789}// CE because it is declared as final
arr[0]=789

}
}

Final Keyword with methods:
class parent{
final void printInfo(){
sout"From Parent "
}
}

class Child extends from Parent{
@override
void printInfo(){
sout"From Child"   //CE Can not override a final method
}
}
final with class:
final class ABC{

void method1(){

}
}
 No class can extend this class
===================================
Inheritance
polymorphism
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Abstraction:
In Abstraction the internal details of the methods are hidden and we only expose the
signature of the methods with return types
Rules:
We can not create the objects of the abstract classes why because the abstract classes
they are incomplete
