Access modifiers:
Access modifiers ar keywords that control the access to class
members(properties,methods,constructor, inner classes and interfaces)
private(can only be accessed in same class)
protected (when we inherit from one class only available to the child)
default(its not a keyword) Can be accessed in the same class and same package
public Available to complete project
================================
Constructor:
is a special block of code that helps us initialize the fields/properties/variables
of a class

class ABC{

ABC(){

}

}

Constructors are very similar to methods but without return types
name of the construct shod be same as of our class
=========================================================
1) If we are in a separate class or if we are inside a static method in the same class
we need an object of the class if we want to access the instance members(fields,methods)
2) when we are declaring something the sequence does not matter the sequence matters when we
are calling something

Constructors rules
-Same name as class name
-no return type(not even void)
-executes automatically during creating object
