============================
Types of variables in java by scope:
There three types of variables in by scope in java:
local
instance
static:
Local variables:
Any variable declared in side any block of code (method constructor, loops,switch etc)
are called local variables:
Benefits:
Occupies the memory for short amount of time once the block is executed memory is free to be utilized somewhere else
limited scope can only be accessed inside that specific block
Instance variables:
any variables declared inside a class but outside of a block of code.
Benefits:
Can be accused anywhere in the class
issues:
keeps on occupying the memory as far as the object stays in th memory should be avoided
static:
static variables are shared across all the instances of a class they belong to class and
can be accessed by just writing the name of the class
