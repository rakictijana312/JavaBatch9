Class 24

Overriding
is when we have same methods in parent and child class.

ROULS:
1)There should be a paretn child relationship between the classes.
2) the return type, name and parametars of the methods they should be same.
3) We cant overdie private methods/Constructros because they dont participate in inheratance
4) We can not decrese visibility of method being overwritten but we can increse
5) When is comes to static methods we say that we are declaring method instead of overriding.
6)
