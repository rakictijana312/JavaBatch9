Overriding
when we have same methods in parent and child classes.
1) there should be a parent child relationship between the classes.
2) the return type,name and parameters of the method they should be same
3)we can not override private methods/Constructors because they don't participate
in inheritance
4) We can not decrease the visibility of a method being overwritten but we can increase
5) when it comes to static methods we say that we are re-declaring a method instead of
overriding it
