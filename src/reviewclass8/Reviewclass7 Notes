Constructors:
Is a special block of code that is executed when we create an object of a class
It is used to initialize the object fields.
Rules:
Access modifier:
we can used access modifiers(public, protected, default(not a keyword), private )
for the constructors
most of the times your constructors will have public access modifiers
if your constructor is public you can create objects of your class anywhere in your
project
if constructors have the default access modifier we can only create the objects of that
class within the same package.

if the constructor is protected and if we are inside the same package
the behaviours will be same as of default we can create an object of that class.
but if we are outside of the package we can not access protected member(fields methods constructor)
by creating an object of that class but we can directly call them or use them inside our class

Non Access modifiers:
static is not allowed because constructor belong to objects not classes
final is not allowed because constructs don not participate in inheritance if something is not
participating in inheritance it does not make sense to stop it from being overridden

abstract means something is incomplete and child class should complete that thing but
because constructors don not participate in inheritance if something is not
participating in inheritance how a child classes can complete that thing.

constructors  do not have return types

constructors can not have any name like methods they must have the same name as of the class name;
There is no difference when it comes to passing the arguments to a constructors or a method

NOTE:
When we are defining something sequence does not matter
sequence matters when we are calling something

week day review  classes will start 6:30 then 7:40 to 8:10
Weekend class will start from 10:15-20

use of constructors:
Constructors are used to initialize the objects(fields)
=================================================================
Inheritance:
Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which a class can inherit members of another class
to avoid the code duplication.
In java three types of inheritances are supported
1) single
2) Multilevel
3)hierarchical
1) Single inheritances:
If in an inheritance relationship if there is only one child and one parent class it is called single
inheritance.
Multilevel inheritance:
If we have a chain of inheritance between different classes it is called multilevel inheritance
A->B->C
hierarchical inheritance:
One parent and many children
Rules
1) we use extends keyword to define the inheritance relationship
2) In java a subclass can have only one super class
3) private fields/methods/constructors do not participate in inheritance
4) Object class is the super class of all the classes in java
5) if super class is declared final we can not inherit it.
6) if a super class has a parameterize constructor child classes must provide a matching constructor
