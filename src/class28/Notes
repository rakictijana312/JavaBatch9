Abstraction:
1) Abstraction is one of the main four OOPS concepts.
2) Abstractions a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
to the user. Abstraction helps use focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
3) we can achieve the abstraction by using
    Abstract classes
    interfaces
4) Abstract class is a class with abstract keyword that has defined and undefined methods
Rules:
1) we can not create the object of abstract class directly.
2) to make a method abstract we use the abstract keyword as not access modifier and we do not
provide the method body.
3) we can not define an abstract method as private, static and final
    we can not make an abstract method as private because private methods do not participate
    in inheritance if something is not participating in inheritance how we can provide the
    implementation for that entity
    why not static
    we can not make abstract methods as static because we can not override static methods
    while abstract methods must be overridden
    why not final
    because final means somethings complete and abstract means something is incomplete
    these two keyword contradict each other
